# Deploy-Hub: My Personal CI/CD Hub
Deploy-Hub is my go-to for managing builds and deployments across all my GitHub repos using my 1-2 self-hosted runners. It handles building packages, creating releases, updating READMEs and GitHub Pages, and publishing to apt, snap, pacman, and more. The magic happens in a public composite action that anyone can use for their own projects. It also tracks which repos use it and their build status.

## How It Works
My repos (like my-username/my-app) push a tag or send a webhook to trigger deploy-hub.
Deploy-Hub uses my runners to build packages, make GitHub releases, update repo assets, and publish to package managers.
A report logs which repos ran and if builds succeeded or failed.
The composite action (action.yml) is reusable for anyone to build, release, and publish their projects.

## Using My Composite Action
Want to use the same setup? Grab my composite action for your workflows:

### Add it to your GitHub workflow:
Use your-username/deploy-hub@action.
Set inputs like repo name, version, and build commands.


Make sure you have a GitHub token and package manager credentials.
Run it on your own runners or GitHub-hosted ones.

## Setup (For Me)

My runners are set up in deploy-hub with tools for building (debhelper, snapcraft, etc.).
Source repos trigger deploy-hub with a simple workflow or webhook.
Reports are saved as GitHub Issues for tracking.

## For Others
My composite action is public! Check action.yml to use it for your own builds, releases, or package publishing. Itâ€™s flexible and ready to go!
